# Image Caption Generator Using Keras Optimization
DS-GA-1019-Final-Project-Group-16

Image caption generator is a cutting-edge application of artificial intelligence that has gained significant attention in recent years. It is a system that automatically generates textual descriptions or captions for images by analyzing the visual features and context of the images. The process involves training the model on a large dataset of images and their corresponding captions using advanced techniques of deep learning and natural language processing.
The accuracy of the image caption generator model depends heavily on the size of the training dataset. Therefore, the training process can be quite time-consuming and computationally expensive. Our project aims at implementing various optimization techniques to reduce the training time and computational requirements while still achieving high accuracy and performance levels.
